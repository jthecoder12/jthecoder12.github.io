    <h3>Brick Breaker is a recreation of Atari Breakout written in Java and <a href="https://libgdx.com/">libGDX</a>.</h3>
    <h3>I plan to add multiplayer and AI to the game.</h3>
    <h3>This game is based on the original Brick Breaker that I made in Unity.</h3>
    <h3>There are downloads available for Windows, MacOS (both Intel and Silicon), and Linux. I have a web version but it is limited as I had to minimize it for TeaVM support. There will be no multiplayer and there is no <a href="https://github.com/SpaiR/imgui-java">ImGui</a> menu.</h3>
    <h3>Play the web verison here (the web version has higher refresh rate (>60) issues): </h3>
